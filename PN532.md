# Using PN532 with Tasmota
There is another option to use this "system" without an Android phone, and its by using a PN532 breakboard connected to Tasmota.

## Install and configure Tasmota onto the ESP8266
- First go to Tasmota installer](https://tasmota.github.io/install) to install tasmota onto the device. 
- Then using this [guide](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/PN532) connect your PN532 to the ESP8266.

## Connecting to Home Assistant
The connection with home assistant is done via MQTT. Everytime the ESP8266 reads a tag, this command is sent via MQTT:
```
tele/tasmota_nfc/SENSOR = {"Time":"2022-03-24T19:48:04","PN532":{"UID":"C4DA0E9C"}}
```
### MQTT Sensor example in Home Assitant
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "NFCR"
    state_topic: "tele/tasmota_nfc/SENSOR"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.PN532.UID }}"
    payload_not_available: "00000000"
    expire_after: 1
    icon: mdi:credit-card-search
```
### [Optional] Trigger `tag_scanned` event
An optional automation can be created to convert the uid received by the sensor into a `tag_scanned` event:
```yaml
alias: NFCR2TAG
description: ''
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.nfcr
    from: unavailable
condition: []
action:
  - event: tag_scanned
    event_data:
      tag_id: '{{states.sensor.NFCR.state.lower()}}'
mode: single

```
